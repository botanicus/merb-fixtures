=== About ===
Fixtures is Merb plugin which provides fixture system for Merb. At this time only DataMapper is supported. Is quite different than Rails fixtures:
  1) Fixtures are written in Ruby, not in YAML, so it's more powerful than YAML one. For example it's much easier to add HABTM relationships.
  2) Fixtures aren't just for testing, but they are useful for development and even for migrations

=== Setup ===
git clone git@github.com:botanicus/merb-fixtures.git
cd merb-fixtures
rake install

# your-app/config/init.rb
Merb.push_path(:fixtures, "app/fixtures/", "*.rb")
# FIXME: autoload needed!

=== Writing fixtures ===
First you must write a fixture:
# app/fixtures/author.rb
fixture_for(Author, :botanicus) do
  self.first_name = "Jakub"
  self.last_name  = "Šťastný"
  self.nickname   = "Botanicus"
  self.homepage   = "http://botablog.cz"
  self.posts      = [ ... ]
end

=== Usage from merb console or specs ===
Now you can use it - from your specs or just from merb console:
# Get fixture named :botanicus
Author.fixture(:botanicus)
=> #<Author last_name="Šťastný" homepage="http://botablog.cz" first_name="Jakub" nickname="Botanicus">

# Get all the author's fixtures
Author.fixtures
=> [#<Author last_name="Šťastný" homepage="http://botablog.cz" first_name="Jakub" nickname="Botanicus">]

=== Usage in migrations ===
# Usage in migrations
migration 1, "Add default author" do
  up do
    Author.fixture(:botanicus).save
  end
  down do
    # foo
  end
end
