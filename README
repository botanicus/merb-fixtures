=== About ===
Fixtures is Merb plugin which provides fixture system for Merb.
  1) Fixtures are written in Ruby, not in YAML, so it's more powerful than YAML one. For example it's much easier to add HABTM relationships.
  2) Fixtures aren't just for testing, but they are useful for development and even for migrations

=== Setup ===
git clone git@github.com:botanicus/merb-fixtures.git
cd merb-fixtures
rake install

# config/init.rb
Merb::BootLoader.after_app_loads do
  # this gem MUST be loaded after your application
  # is ready, because it use your models
  dependency 'merb-fixtures'
end

By default, fixtures folder is app/fixtures. If you like to puts your fixtures on other place, feel free to change it in your init.rb:
# config/init.rb
Merb::Plugins.config[:fixtures] = {
  :directory => Merb.root / "app" / "fixtures"
}

=== Writing fixtures ===
First you must write a fixture:
# app/fixtures/author.rb
fixture_for(Author, :botanicus) do
  self.first_name = "Jakub"
  self.last_name  = "Šťastný"
  self.nickname   = "Botanicus"
  self.homepage   = "http://botablog.cz"
  self.posts      = [ ... ]
end

=== Usage from merb console or specs ===
Now you can use it - from your specs or just from merb console:
# Get fixture named :botanicus
Author.fixture(:botanicus)
=> #<Author last_name="Šťastný" homepage="http://botablog.cz" first_name="Jakub" nickname="Botanicus">

# Get all the author's fixtures
Author.fixtures
=> [#<Author last_name="Šťastný" homepage="http://botablog.cz" first_name="Jakub" nickname="Botanicus">]

=== Usage in migrations ===
# Usage in migrations
migration 1, "Add default author" do
  up do
    Author.fixture(:botanicus).save
  end
  down do
    # foo
  end
end
